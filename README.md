Rectangle Union and Contour Visualization - Computational Geometry
This project focuses on implementing an algorithm for calculating the union of rectangles in a plane and visualizing their contour. The goal is to efficiently compute the area of the union of these rectangles and create a graphical representation of their contour.

Problem Statement
Given a set of 𝑛 rectangles in a plane, each defined by its coordinates and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the project aims to:

Calculate the area of the union of these rectangles.
Create a visual representation of the contour of the union.
Key Features
